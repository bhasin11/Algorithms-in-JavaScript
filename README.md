# Algorithms-in-JavaScript

<b>Algorithms, Data Structures</b> and <b>Coding Challenges</b> implemented in JavaScript.

This repository is a collection of algorithms, data structures and coding challenges which I've implement over a period of time. The algorithms/solutions are tried to be implemented considering effecient Time and Space Complexity approaches. The solutions are well tested and, unless noted, are believe to be 100% correct.

So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements: 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area. 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W. 3.

| <b>Assign Cookies</b>  <br>Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number. Note: You may assume the greed factor is always positive. You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.              | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/findContentChildren.js)                               |Easy|
