| Description   | Solution | Difficulty |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <b>Hamming Distance</b>  <br>  The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.               | [Click](https://github.com/duereg/js-algorithms/blob/master/lib/dataStructures/binaryHeap.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Number Complement</b>  <br>  Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.       | [Click](https://github.com/duereg/js-algorithms/blob/master/lib/dataStructures/binaryHeap.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Keyboard Row</b>  <br>  Given a List of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of alphabet on only one row's of American keyboard.               | [Click](https://github.com/duereg/js-algorithms/blob/master/lib/dataStructures/binaryHeap.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Fizz Buzz</b>  <br>  Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.               | [Click](https://github.com/duereg/js-algorithms/blob/master/lib/dataStructures/binaryHeap.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Reverse String</b>  <br>  Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.               | [Click](https://github.com/duereg/js-algorithms/blob/master/lib/dataStructures/binaryHeap.js)                               |Easy|
