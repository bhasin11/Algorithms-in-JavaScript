# Algorithms-in-JavaScript

<b>Algorithms, Data Structures</b> and <b>Coding Challenges</b> implemented in JavaScript.

This repository is a collection of algorithms, data structures and coding challenges which I've implement over a period of time. The algorithms/solutions are tried to be implemented considering effecient Time and Space Complexity approaches. The solutions are well tested and, unless noted, are believe to be 100% correct.

# Coding Challenges in JavaScript
In this section, you can find different coding challenges and their soluitons. 

| Description   | Solution | Difficulty |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <b>Hamming Distance</b>  <br>  The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/temp/src/hammingDistance.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Number Complement</b>  <br>  Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.       | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/temp/src/findComplement.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Keyboard Row</b>  <br>  Given a List of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of alphabet on only one row's of American keyboard.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/temp/src/findWords.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Fizz Buzz</b>  <br>  Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/temp/src/fizzBuzz.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Reverse String</b>  <br>  Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/temp/src/reverseString.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Island Perimeter</b>  <br>You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/islandPerimeter.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Nim Game</b>  <br>You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones. Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/canWinNim.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Max Consecutive Ones</b>  <br>Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/findMaxConsecutiveOnes.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Detect Capital</b>  <br>Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not. We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds: All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA", All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode", Only the first letter in this word is capital if it has more than one letter, like "Google". Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/detectCapitalUse.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array</b>  <br>Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/findDisappearedNumbers.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Single Number</b>  <br>Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.              | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/singleNumber.js)                               |Easy|
